This package contains the implemenatation of Kalman Filter using a GPU.

For usage, see the file in kalman.cu

The matrix functions  used the CPU implementations are inlcuded in matrix.cu

The kernel codes for the GPU implementation are inlcuded in the matrix_kernel.co

This folder contains a function for inverting a symmetric positive definit matrix
using a GPU. For usage see the file inverse.cpp

The executable file is : kalman

Sample run:

$make
$kalman -ns 1000 -no 250
